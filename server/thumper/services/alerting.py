"""Route a fired-tripwire event to every configured alert plugin. Best-effort:
one plugin failing must never drop the alert or break the trigger response. Each
plugin's outcome is recorded in delivery_attempts so failures are visible instead
of silently logged.

The trigger endpoint schedules `deliver_alert` as a background task; it owns its
own session because the request-scoped one is closed once the response is sent.
